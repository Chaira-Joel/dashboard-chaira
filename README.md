Final assignment: React Student Dashboard
For this final assignment, you will make a "real-life" project. This will be a project of which the end result will actually be used by Winc Academy: a Student Dashboard! Goal: to make it easy for Winc teachers to see how the students evaluate the assignments

For this assignment I divided the assignment up in an epic and user stories to make it more manageable:

Epic:
Goal: to make it easier for Winc teachers to see how the students evaluate the assignments.

Design: See per assignment the evaluation of each student in a Bar chart.

User stories:
US1: Dashboard overview

As a user when I open the homepage of the application, I want to see an overview in the form of a bar chart of the evaluations fun and difficult of all students.

US2 Distinction

As a user I must be able to distinguish at a glance between the assignments and the fun/difficult evaluation.

Acceptance criteria:

Bar chart evaluations fun has one color
Bart chart evaluations difficult has another color
US3: Separate routing per student

As a user I want to see a list of names of all students and be able to click on one of these students.

Acceptance criteria:

When I click on a student name I am taken to the route
The bar chart adjusts with the data of only this student
US4: Slicing and dicing

As a user I want to be able to indicate by means of a checkbox whether I only want to show in the Bar chart how nice the assignment was, only how difficult it was or both.

Acceptance criteria

Checkbox is visible
When clicking the checkbox, data is filtered based on the checkbox value
